# happy-face-recognition
This project builds a machine learning model that classifies facial images as happy or non-happy. The focus is on a transparent ML pipeline: data preprocessing, baseline modeling, evaluation, and error analysis. Emphasis is placed on interpretability, reproducibility, and clear reasoning rather than black-box performance.
