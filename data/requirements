Instructions:
1. Download the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle using the link above.
2. Extract the archive locally.
3. Organize the data into train and test directories inside the data folder.
4. Each directory should contain subfolders corresponding to emotion classes.
5. Image data is not included in the repository.

Expected path:
data/train/happy/xxx.png
data/train/sad/xxx.png
data/train/neutral/xxx.png
...

data/test/happy/xxx.png
data/test/sad/xxx.png
...

Label definition:
Happy:
- happy

Non-happy:
- angry
- disgust
- fear
- sad
- surprise
- neutral

All non-happy classes are merged into a single negative class during preprocessing.

Notes:
- Images are grayscale with resolution 48x48.
- Facial expression labels may contain noise.
- The dataset is used to study visual patterns of happiness, not emotional state.
- Models trained on this dataset are not expected to generalize perfectly to real-world images.

Python dependencies required to run the project:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- scikit-learn
- opencv-python
